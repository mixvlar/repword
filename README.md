# Simple SRS Vocabulary Trainer

A small personal tool for learning words using spaced repetition. I built this to automate my vocabulary drills without overcomplicating the setup.

## Core Idea
The script schedules word reviews at specific intervals (1, 2, 3, 7, 30 days) to help with long-term retention. 
- **Simple Flask UI** for quick interactions.
- **AI-assisted core:** Generated and tweaked using AI for personal efficiency.
- **Focus:** Functionality over fancy architecture.

## Getting Started

1. **Install requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Start**
   python main.py
